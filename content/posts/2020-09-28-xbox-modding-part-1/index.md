## Background
A few years ago one of my friends gave me an original Xbox he modded. Me being the lazy individual I am didn't touch it till a few months ago when I finally bought an AV cable and a controller for it. Because it is already soft modded I wont be doing anything too much in this part but there are a few things that need to be done so I can do a number of hardware mods.
